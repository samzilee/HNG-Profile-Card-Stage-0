          <p>
            I’m a self-taught web developer who started learning during my SIWES
            program when my original placement fell through. I’ve built several
            hands-on projects including a movie website, a contact saver app in
            React, and a game that challenges players to guess a bar’s width. I
            enjoy learning by doing experiment with HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
            React, Tailwind CSS, and watching how small ideas grow into full,
            interactive applications.

          <h2>Goals</h2>
          <p>
            My main goal in this program is to strengthen my frontend
            development skills, especially around accessibility, responsiveness,
            and clean UI design. I also want to get comfortable building
            complete applications from a simple profile card to multi-page apps
            and gradually prepare myself for backend development using Node.js
            and databases like MySQL or Appwrite. Ultimately, I aim to become a
            full-stack developer who can build practical, real-world projects
            confidently.

          <h2>Areas of Low Confidence</h2>
          <p>
            I still feel a bit unsure when it comes to advanced form validation,
            backend integration, and optimizing app performance. Sometimes I
            need more practice with accessibility (ARIA labels, keyboard
            navigation) and writing cleaner, more maintainable code. But I’m
            improving steadily through each challenge, mistakes are just part of
            my learning process.

          <h2>Note to future Self</h2>
          <p>
            Keep pushing your limits and don't be afraid to ask for help when
            you need it. Remember that every expert was once a beginner, and the
            journey is just as important as the destination.

          <h2>Extra Thoughts</h2>
          <p>
            This journey has taught me that persistence is more powerful than
            talent. Every time I struggled with a concept, I found an answer
            through patience and practice. Frontend Wizards challenges like this
            push me to think like a real developer focusing not just on looks,
            but on structure, accessibility, and user experience. I’m proud of
            how much I’ve learned, and I’m excited for what’s next.
